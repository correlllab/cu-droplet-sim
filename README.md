Installation and Build Guide
----------------------------
### Dependencies

Microsoft Windows is currently the only supported platform for this simulator, although the source code for the library itself is platform agnostic. To build the simulator you will need the following tools:

1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Pro: If you are a student or associated with any academic institution and have an '@edu' email address you can get VS 2010 for free from https://www.dreamspark.com/ .
2. [Qt v4.8.5](http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.5/): The installer you are looking for is called 'qt-win-opensource-4.8.5-vs2010.exe'. It is highly recommended that you use the default install location for Qt.
3. (Optional) [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html): If you want to generate your own documentation.
