Installation and Build Guide
----------------------------
### Supported Platforms
Microsoft Windows is currently the only supported platform for this simulator, although the source code for the library itself is platform agnostic.

### Dependencies
To build the simulator you will need the following tools:

1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Pro: If you are a student or associated with any academic institution and have an '@edu' email address you can get VS 2010 for free from https://www.dreamspark.com/ .
2. [Qt v4.8.5](http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.5/): The installer you are looking for is called 'qt-win-opensource-4.8.5-vs2010.exe'. It is highly recommended that you use the default install location for Qt.
3. (Optional) [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html): If you want to generate your own documentation.

### Build
VS 2010 solution file location.
